**Resident Alien (for U.S. tax purposes)**

You are considered a resident alien if you meet either of the following IRS tests:

- **Green Card Test**: You are a lawful permanent resident of the United States at any time during the tax year; or
- **Substantial Presence Test**: You meet the IRS physical presence requirements based on the number of days you were present in the U.S. over the past three years.
- If you meet either test, you are treated as a U.S. person for tax purposes and should generally complete **Form W-9**, not **Form W-8BEN**.
